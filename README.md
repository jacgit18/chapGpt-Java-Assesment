Project Title: Java Utility Library

Project Description:
You are tasked with developing a utility library in Java that provides various functionalities related to multi-threading, serialization, collections, Java system logs, annotations, and streams. The library should be designed to be reusable and provide convenience methods for common tasks in these areas.

Requirements:

1. Multi-threading:
   - Implement a class that demonstrates the usage of threads and synchronization mechanisms.
   - The class should perform a computationally intensive task using multiple threads and demonstrate thread synchronization to avoid data races.

2. Serialization:
   - Create a class that can be serialized and deserialized.
   - Demonstrate the usage of different serialization mechanisms (e.g., Java Serialization, JSON, XML).

3. Collections:
   - Implement a custom collection class that extends one of the standard Java collection classes (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
   - Add custom methods to the collection class that perform specific operations on the elements.

4. Java System Logs:
   - Create a logger class that utilizes the Java logging framework (java.util.logging).
   - Demonstrate logging of various log levels (e.g., info, warning, error) and log messages to a file.

5. Annotations:
   - Create a custom annotation that can be applied to methods or classes.
   - Demonstrate the usage of the annotation by creating an aspect that intercepts methods annotated with it and performs additional actions.

6. Streams:
   - Implement a class that reads data from a file using Java Streams.
   - Perform some operations on the data using stream operations (e.g., filtering, mapping, reducing).

Deliverables:

1. Java source code files (.java) for all the classes and interfaces implemented.
2. A README file with instructions on how to compile and run the project.
3. Any additional documentation or notes on the design decisions and challenges faced during the implementation.

Note: You are encouraged to use appropriate design patterns, adhere to best practices, and write clean, modular, and well-documented code.

Feel free to modify or expand upon this project outline according to your specific requirements.
